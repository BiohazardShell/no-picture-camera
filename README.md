# The No-picture Camera project

Raspberry Pi with camera and OpenCV, a better solution than CCTV

## Why this project?

## How is this done?

## What is needed to deploy some No-picture Cameras?

Read [instructions to setup a standalone camera](docs/setup.standalone.md), including OpenCV, the scanning software, the InfluxDB database and the Grafana dashboard, all on the same Raspberry PI.

If you have multiple boards, then consider [instructions to connect smart cameras over LoRa](docs/setup.lora.md). All cameras will run OpenCV, and one Raspberry Pi will act as a central datastore, with InfluxDB and Grafana, so that you can enjoy cameras data from a single pane of glass.

## Where to find additional assistance?

Well, maybe you would like to check [Frequently asked questions](docs/questions.md) and related responses.
Then you can [raise an issue at the GitHub project page](https://github.com/bernard357/smart-video-counter) and get support from the project team.
